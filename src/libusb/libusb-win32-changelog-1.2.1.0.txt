LibUsb-Win32 Change Log

V1.2.1.0 (07/28/2010)
=======================
* Updated bulk.c to include async i/o example code.

* Fixed usb_install_driver_np() issue with inf-wizard generated infs.

* Fixed inf2cat.exe issue with inf-wizard generated infs.
  
* Added 'Install Now' feature to inf-wizard. (libwdi)

* Added embedded libusb-win32 binaries to inf-wizard. (libwdi)

* Added libwdi (http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libwdi) to inf-wizard. 

* Added get cached configuration request to usb_open(). This is a new
  control code that involves no device i/o and allows 
  usb_set_configuration() to be omitted if the driver has already
  configured it.

* Fixed set_configuration() failure for devices that do not properly
  support get_configuration().

V1.2.0.0 (07/07/2010)
=======================
* First signed driver release! The libusb-win32 kernel driver (libusb0.sys)
  can now be used on x64 Windows machines that require signed drivers. 

* Fixed 2128187 reported by Tim Green. usb_get_descriptor() can fail
  because the given buffer of 8 bytes is too small.

* Fixed 2928293 reported by Tim Green. Sometimes the call to 
  usb_fetch_and_parse_descriptors() in usb_find_devices() can fail. This 
  patch moves the LIST_ADD to after a successful read of the device's 
  configuration descriptors.

* Fixed issue causing libusb-win32 to not act as power policy owner
  when it should.

* Fixed issue in which on rare occasion, a libusb-win32 filter device could
  run as a "normal" device.
  
* Fixed filter driver issue for device using wudfr.sys.

* Added large transfer splitting to driver (bulk, int, iso). NOTE:
  The dll continues to break transfers in the same manner it always has.


V1.1.14.3 (06/12/2010)
=======================
* Remove get_configuration() request from usb_open().  This caused claim
  interface to fail when used as a filter driver.
  
V1.1.14.0 (06/01/2010)
=======================
* Updated logging functions and standardized log message display format.

* Updated inf-wizard to use the new directory format for the libusb-win32
  binaries.

* Updated package directories to reflect the winddk BUILDARCH env variable.
  (i64 := ia64, x64 := amd64)
  
* Added request to get the current configuration in usb_open().

* Fixed 2960644 (reported by farthen) crash on shutdown with x64 based
  systems while using inf files for each libusb device.

* Added additional log message only included in debug/chk builds.
  
* Updated default log levels to highest verbose level for debug builds.

* Added test signing support to the libusb-win32 make.cmd. This allows
  libusb0.sys and libusb0.dll to be signed with a digital signature.
  (see make.cmd for mmore details)

* Added MSVC 2008 project files

* Moved version defines to an include file (libusb_version.h)
  This file is generated from libusb_version_h.in with "make.cmd makever"

* Removed all "dist" commands from cyg/mingw makefile.  Instead use "make.cmd"
  in the "ddk_make" directory.

* Fixed filter setup not running in 64bit mode

* Fixed 64bit inf-wizard, testlibusb-win builds

* Added set initial config value #1 when the driver is not a filter.
  optionally, the initial configuration value can be specified in the inf
  file: HKR,,"InitialConfigValue",0x00010001,<your config value>

* Added support for querying device registry keys 
 (LIBUSB_IOCTL_GET_CUSTOM_REG_PROPERTY)

* Added support for querying device properties 
 (LIBUSB_IOCTL_GET_DEVICE_PROPERTY)

* Fixed possible race condition in kernel add_device()

* Updated default ddk build version number to 1.1.14.0 to facilitate
  Microsoft WHQL submission.

* Added DDK build distribution system.  Official libusb-win32 releases 
 (after 0.1.12.2) are built using Microsoft's WinDDK.  (see make.cmd)

* Fixed 2658937 (reported by Tim Roberts) The libusb-win32 driver always
  acts as a power policy owner.
